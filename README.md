 Final project for math336, differential equations 2.

##### Abstract for the writeup 
The method of eigenfunction expansion is developed and demonstrated for solutions to the Helmholtz equation on the unit disc. Through this method, Greens' functions for the wave and heat equation are generated and particular solutions are analyzed, to show the variety of dynamics possible within the realm of partial differential equations.

Alongside this writeup and explanation is mathematica code for generating solutions to the wave and heat equation. While I only include the code for some particular solutions I wrote about, the function DiscAnim allows one to generate any animation of a time dependent function on a disc. 

Note that the animations generated are very large in file size. My goal is to find a method for generating these solutions using Python.
